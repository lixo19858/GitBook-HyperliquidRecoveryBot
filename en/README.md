**한국어**: 귀하의 주소가 제3자 검증 도구에 의해 고위험으로 표시되었습니다. 이 프론트엔드 인터페이스는 고위험 주소의 하이퍼리퀴드 블록체인 연결을 지원하지 않습니다. 오류라고 생각되는 경우, 지원 티켓을 열 수 있습니다.

**Français**: Votre adresse a été signalée comme à haut risque par un outil de filtrage tiers. Cette interface frontend ne prend pas en charge la connexion à la blockchain Hyperliquid par des adresses à haut risque. Si vous pensez qu'il s'agit d'une erreur, vous pouvez ouvrir un ticket de support.
